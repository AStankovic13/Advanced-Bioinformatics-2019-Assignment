## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r}
"Task 1"
sum(5:55)
```
```{r}
"Task 2"
sumfun<-function(n){
  sum(5:n)
}
sumfun(10)
sumfun(20)
sumfun(100)
```

```{r}
"Task 3"
a=1
b=1

print(a)
print(b)

for(i in 1:12) {
  c=a+b
  print(c)
  a=b
  b=c
}
```
```{r}
"Task 4"

#Import ggplot2
library(ggplot2)
#Load the data
data(mtcars)
#Convert miles per gallon into a factor from numeric 
mtcars$gear<-as.factor(mtcars$gear)
#Generate a box plot of gear against mpg and color by gear 
ggplot(mtcars, aes(x=gear,y=mpg,fill=gear)) + geom_boxplot()
```

```{r}
"Task 5"
#Fit a linear model with lm, with cars data (speed and breaking distance)
model<-lm(dist~speed,data=cars)
summary(model)
```
```{r}
"Task 6"
plot(data=cars, dist~speed)
abline(model)
```
